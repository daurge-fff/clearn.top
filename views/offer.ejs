            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 9, 2025</p>

            <h2>1. AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Code & Learn (clearn.top). These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you, a parent or legal guardian ("Client," "you"), on behalf of your child ("Student"), and the service provider, German Vitiaz and/or any authorized tutors or contractors acting on his behalf ("Instructor," "we," "us").</p>
            <p>By purchasing or using our services, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you must not use our Services.</p>

            <h2>2. SERVICES</h2>
            <p>The Instructor provides personalized, one-on-one online programming lessons ("Services") as described on the website https://clearn.top ("Website").</p>

            <h2>3. PAYMENT AND CURRENCY</h2>
            <p>Prices are listed on the Website in Euro (EUR) and/or US Dollar (USD). All Services must be paid for in full, in advance. Payments are processed via third-party gateways, and by making a payment, you agree to their respective terms.</p>

            <h2>4. SCHEDULING, CANCELLATION, AND REFUND POLICY</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Lessons are scheduled by mutual agreement after payment is confirmed.</li>
                <li><strong>Client's Right to Cancel/Reschedule:</strong> The Client may cancel or reschedule a lesson without charge by providing at least 24 hours' notice before the scheduled start time. A timely cancellation entitles the Client to a full refund or credit.</li>
                <li><strong>Late Cancellation & No-Show:</strong> If notice is given less than 24 hours in advance, or if the Student fails to attend, the Service is considered rendered and is non-refundable.</li>
                <li><strong>Instructor's Right to Cancel:</strong> In the event the Instructor must cancel a lesson, the Client will be notified and offered the choice to either reschedule the lesson at no additional charge or receive a full refund.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Instructor's Materials:</strong> All teaching materials provided by the Instructor are his exclusive intellectual property and are for the Student's personal educational use only.</li>
                <li><strong>Student's Creations:</strong> The Student retains full ownership of the unique creative works they produce during the lessons.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>6. MODIFICATION OF TERMS</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will post the revised Terms on the Website and update the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of any changes constitutes acceptance of those changes. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.</p>

            <h2>7. CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>
            <p>The Client agrees to ensure that both the Client and the Student will interact with the Instructor in a respectful and professional manner. Any form of harassment, abuse, or disrespectful behavior will result in immediate termination of all Services without a refund.</p>

            <h2>8. DISCLAIMERS AND NO WARRANTIES</h2>
            <p>The Services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, and we are not responsible for any technical issues arising from your internet connection, hardware, or third-party software. We do not guarantee any specific learning outcome for the Student.</p>
            
            <h2>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Instructor be liable for any indirect, special, or consequential damages. The Instructor's total liability for any claim arising from these Terms is strictly limited to the amount you paid for the single lesson giving rise to the claim.</p>

            <h2>10. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Instructor from any claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your or the Student's use of the Service; or (ii) your violation of these Terms or any third-party right.</p>

            <h2>11. FORCE MAJEURE</h2>
            <p>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance under these Terms for causes beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, pandemics, or major network failures.</p>
            
            <h2>12. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. The parties agree to first attempt to resolve any dispute amicably. If a resolution is not reached within 30 days, the parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
